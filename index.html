         <h2>Victoria Falls</h2>
         <p>Outdoorsy types travel far and wide to admire this breathtaking UNESCO World Heritage Site. Straddling the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Mosi Oa Tunya National Park, Victoria Falls is roughly twice as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most jaw-dropping waterfalls. To see this natural wonder at its prime, plan a visit in April or May when the region's rainy season has concluded. Popular vantage points include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's Pool. When you're not enjoying the view from above, go whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire the falls from a different angle.</p>

         <h2>Kruger National Park</h2>
         <p>You'll spot plenty of animals – ranging from lions to rhinos to elephants to giraffes – in this massive game preserve in South Africa. Kruger National Park's network of paved roads makes it easier to navigate than Serengeti, and it tends to be cheaper to visit. However, its popularity (especially from May to October, which are the best months for wildlife viewing) means you're more likely to encounter hordes of visitors during game drives. Consider visiting one of the park's private game reserves for a more exclusive experience, and to ensure lodging, flight and tour availability, you'll likely want to finalize your trip at least a year in advance. </p>
