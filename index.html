              <p>
                Amboseli National Park (formerly Maasai Amboseli Game Reserve),
                is a National Park in Kajiado County, Kenya. The name "Amboseli
                comes from a Maasai word Empusel meaning "salty dust place", and
                it is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds of
                elephants.

              <h2>Victoria Falls</h2>
              <p>
                Outdoorsy types travel far and wide to admire this breathtaking
                UNESCO World Heritage Site. Straddling the border between Zambia
                and Zimbabwe in Mosi Oa Tunya National Park, Victoria Falls is
                roughly twice as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one
                of the world's most jaw-dropping waterfalls. To see this natural
                wonder at its prime, plan a visit in April or May when the
                region's rainy season has concluded. Popular vantage points
                include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's
                Pool. When you're not enjoying the view from above, go
                whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire the falls from
                a different angle.

              <p>
                You'll spot plenty of animals – ranging from lions to rhinos to
                elephants to giraffes – in this massive game preserve in South
                Africa. Kruger National Park's network of paved roads makes it
                easier to navigate than Serengeti, and it tends to be cheaper to
                visit. However, its popularity (especially from May to October,
                which are the best months for wildlife viewing) means you're
                more likely to encounter hordes of visitors during game drives.
                Consider visiting one of the park's private game reserves for a
                more exclusive experience, and to ensure lodging, flight and
                tour availability, you'll likely want to finalize your trip at
                least a year in advance.
